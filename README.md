# Thera Bank Case Study
### Personal Loan Campaign Classification Using Machine Learning Models

This case study is prepared for Thera Bank for their Personal Loan Campaign so that they can target right customers who have a higher probability of purchasing the loan. The objective is to build the best model which can classify right customers.
We will be performing below steps and will analyze the data using Data Mining techniques to identify such customers:

1. Data Cleanup and Preparation
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Split Data into Development and Holdout sets
4. Use different Algorithms to build classification model
5. Predict for the Validation data for different models
6. Review the Model Performance
7. Actionable Insights
8. Conclusion

### Context:
This case is about a bank (Thera Bank) which has a growing customer base. Majority of these customers are liability customers (depositors) with varying size of deposits. The number of customers who are also borrowers (asset customers) is quite small, and the bank is interested in expanding this base rapidly to bring in more loan business and in the process, earn more through the interest on loans. In particular, the management wants to explore ways of converting its liability customers to personal loan customers (while retaining them as depositors). A campaign that the bank ran last year for liability customers showed a healthy conversion rate of over 9% success. This has encouraged the retail marketing department to devise campaigns to better target marketing to increase the success ratio with a minimal budget.

The department wants to build a model that will help them identify the potential customers who have a higher probability of purchasing the loan. This will increase the success ratio while at the same time reduce the cost of the campaign.

In this case study, we will see how we could harness the power of machine learning to target the campaigns towards the right set of customers, thereby increasing conversion propensity. We will be using past data available on the demography, bank details, and transaction patterns of customers who have responded and not responded to a personal loan campaign, as training data to predict the probability if a customer will respond to the campaign.
In machine learning terminology, this is a classification problem and there are several classification algorithms available to build a prediction model out of which we will be using the following:

1. Logistic regression
2. K Nearest Classifier
3. Naive Bayes
